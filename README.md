<h3> Hello there! ❣️</h3>
<p> I started programming at 16, when I graduated from a technical course in Web Design. I was able to learn about HTML and ASP languages and finish with the programming of a tourism website as a course conclusion work. Currently, I have been working with Programming and Web Development, a world not so far away for me. I am improving my front-end knowledge, such as HTML/HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.
